Hey there! üëã I'm Asif. Welcome to my corner of the internet where I share my passion for Linux ricing, guides, and all things related to Debian and Arch-based distros, with a special emphasis on Arch for its extensive software pool.
It's just that grabbing stuff from the aur is more convenient for people like me who are too impatient to wait for stuff to compile lol.
## Quick Bio

Just a teenager. I like tinkering with stuff, hence my interest for linux.
I like writing C++ code. Python too. Maybe a lil bit of bash scripting at times but I am not good at it. Oh yes, and ricing my desktop, I like that too :p
## My Linux Journey

I've been immersed in the world of Linux for [3 years], and I've found my home in Debian and Arch-based distributions. The flexibility and customization options that Arch offers have fueled my interest in creating unique and personalized desktop environments.

## What To Expect

- **Linux Rices:** Explore my custom desktop setups, rice configurations, and visual tweaks to make your Linux experience truly yours.
- **Guides:** Step-by-step tutorials on various aspects of Linux, from system configurations to software installations. Whether you're a beginner or an advanced user, there's something for everyone.
- **Arch Adventures:** Dive into the Arch Linux ecosystem with me. Discover new software, tools, and tips to enhance your Arch experience.
